\LT{Project Title:} CMB Polarization Foreground Effects on B-modes and Lensing

\LT{Project PI:} K. Huffenberger

\LT{Program Name:} NSF AAG 2009870

\LT{Period of Performance:} 08/01/2020 - 07/31/2023

\LT{Amount} \$533,714

\LT{FTE:} 1 Month/Year

\LT{Summary of Work:} 
This work will develop analytic and numerical models of the microwave ISM. We
will use these tools to understand the contamination by the local ISM to lensing
and CMB observations.
