\LT{Project Title:} Modeling CMB polarization foregrounds and their isotropy
violation

\LT{Project PI:} K. Huffenberger 

\LT{Program Name and award number:} NASA ATP  NNX17AF87G

\LT{Period of Performance:} 01/08/2017 - 02/02/2021

\LT{Amount} \$428,043.00

\LT{FTE:} 1.0 Months/Year

\LT{Summary of Work:} In this project, we are modeling the CMB foregrounds using
a number of techniques, including an analytic filament model and simulations.
The proposed work continues and extends the researching ongoing in this project.

\LT{Project Title:} Signatures of Type Ia Supernovae Explosions and their
Cosmological Implications

\LT{Project PI:} P. Hoeflich 

\LT{Program Name and award number:} NSF AAG AST-1715133

\LT{Period of Performance:} 10/01/2017 - 09/31/2021 

\LT{Amount} \$460,498.00

\LT{FTE:} 0.0 Months/Year

\LT{Summary of Work:} In this project, we examine the role of magnetic fields in
Type Ia supernovae.  There
is a synergistic overlap with the proposed work in the shared use of high
performance computing software and resources.

\LT{Project Title:} CMB Polarization Foreground Effects on B-modes and Lensing

\LT{Project PI:} K. Huffenberger

\LT{Program Name:} NSF AAG 

\LT{Period of Performance:} 08/01/2020 - 07/31/2023

\LT{Amount} \$533,714

\LT{FTE:} 1 Month/Year

\LT{Summary of Work:} 
This work will develop analytic and numerical models of the microwave ISM. We
will use these tools to understand the contamination by the local ISM to lensing
and CMB observations.
